              <p>
                In my senior year of High School, I focused on a Computer Math
                stream along with Physics, Chemistry, and English. I then
                pursued higher education at Trent University, where I completed
                an Honours Science program in Computer Science with a
                specialization in Software Engineering.

            <h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
            <p>
              I have developed a strong proficiency in programming across
              various languages, including C#, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, C,
              JavaScript, and Java. During high school, I created a Hotel
              Management system in C++ to handle customer bookings. At
              university, I collaborated on a project to build a neural network
              using TensorFlow in Python, designed to recognize digits drawn on
              a canvas. For my final year project, I worked with a team to
              develop an advanced user interface for WeBWork, enabling the
              seamless insertion of complex symbols and equations.
